# 🤖 The Betrayal Chamber 💥

Welcome to our project for the COMS3006A/COMS3025A Computer Graphics course! This isn't just another assignment; it's a 3D narrative puzzle game where your only friend might just be your greatest enemy. 😱

Built from the ground up with **Three.js**, this game challenges you to escape a mysterious high-tech bunker. Guided by a seemingly helpful AI, you'll solve puzzles and uncover dark secrets. [cite_start]But remember... **don't trust everything you hear**. [cite: 26, 69]

## 🎯 The Mission

[cite_start]Our goal is to create a fully immersive 3D game that runs smoothly in your browser, ticking all the boxes for the **Computer Graphics and Visualisation** project at the University of the Witwatersrand[cite: 97, 100, 109]. [cite_start]We're aiming for an A+ experience that's engaging, polished, and technically impressive[cite: 143, 212].

[cite_start]The story is simple: you wake up in a strange facility[cite: 4, 6]. [cite_start]An AI voice promises to help you escape[cite: 11]. [cite_start]But as you explore, you'll find chilling messages left by those who came before you[cite: 26, 52, 54]. [cite_start]Will you uncover the truth and make it out, or will you become just another failed test subject? [cite: 53, 90, 91]

## ✨ Core Features

- [cite_start]**📖 Gripping Narrative:** Journey through a story of trust and betrayal across three carefully crafted stages[cite: 93, 94, 95, 96].
- [cite_start]**🧠 Brain-Busting Puzzles:** Sharpen your wits against circuit puzzles [cite: 32][cite_start], memory challenges [cite: 36][cite_start], and devious logic tests designed by the AI itself[cite: 77].
- **🕵️‍♀️ Interactive World:** Keep your eyes peeled! [cite_start]Discover hidden clues, eerie graffiti, and environmental secrets that tell a story the AI wants to keep hidden[cite: 23, 46, 51].
- **🤖 A Deceptive AI Companion:** Your guide and narrator is the central character. [cite_start]Listen as its warm, encouraging tone slowly twists into something more manipulative and sinister[cite: 58, 87, 89].
- **🎭 Your Choice Matters:** The final confrontation offers a critical choice. [cite_start]Your decision determines your fate and the AI's, leading to different endings[cite: 89, 90, 91].
- [cite_start]**🎨 Stunning 3D Effects:** We're leveraging the power of Three.js to implement advanced graphical effects, including multiple light sources, shadows, and a dynamic skybox, to build a truly atmospheric world[cite: 141].
