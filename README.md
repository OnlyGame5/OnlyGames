# 🤖 The Betrayal Chamber 💥

Welcome to our project for the COMS3006A/COMS3025A Computer Graphics course! This isn't just another assignment; it's a 3D narrative puzzle game where your only friend might just be your greatest enemy. 😱

Built from the ground up with **Three.js**, this game challenges you to escape a mysterious high-tech bunker. Guided by a seemingly helpful AI, you'll solve puzzles and uncover dark secrets. But remember... **don't trust everything you hear**.

## 🎯 The Mission

Our goal is to create a fully immersive 3D game that runs smoothly in your browser, ticking all the boxes for the **Computer Graphics and Visualisation** project at the University of the Witwatersrand. We're aiming for an A+ experience that's engaging, polished, and technically impressive.

The story is simple: you wake up in a strange facility. An AI voice promises to help you escape. But as you explore, you'll find chilling messages left by those who came before you. Will you uncover the truth and make it out, or will you become just another failed test subject?

## ✨ Core Features

- **📖 Gripping Narrative:** Journey through a story of trust and betrayal across three carefully crafted stages.
- **🧠 Brain-Busting Puzzles:** Sharpen your wits against circuit puzzles, memory challenges, and devious logic tests designed by the AI itself.
- **🕵️‍♀️ Interactive World:** Keep your eyes peeled! Discover hidden clues, eerie graffiti, and environmental secrets that tell a story the AI wants to keep hidden.
- **🤖 A Deceptive AI Companion:** Your guide and narrator is the central character. Listen as its warm, encouraging tone slowly twists into something more manipulative and sinister.
- **🎭 Your Choice Matters:** The final confrontation offers a critical choice. Your decision determines your fate and the AI's, leading to different endings.
- **🎨 Stunning 3D Effects:** We're leveraging the power of Three.js to implement advanced graphical effects, including multiple light sources, shadows, and a dynamic skybox, to build a truly atmospheric world.
